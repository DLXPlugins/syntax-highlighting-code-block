# Code Syntax Highlighting Block

A WordPress plugin which extends Gutenberg by adding syntax highlighting to the core code block.


Example:

<img src="screenshot.png" title="Screenshot example in use" alt="screen shot" width="554" height="202" style="border:1px solid #333"/>


### Usage

Install code-syntax-block plugin to your WordPress plugins directory and activate. You can download a zip from the  [releases page](https://github.com/mkaz/code-syntax-block/releases).

When creating a new code block, select `Code` block, and then in the Inspector (Block Controls on the Right) select the language for the code. The code will not change within the editor, but you'll see a small label with the selected language.

On the front-end when the post is being viewed, the code will be color syntax highlighted.
